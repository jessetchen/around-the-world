Instructions to build program

1. Download entire folder.
2. Run index.html in a browser (preferrably Google chrome)

Notes
- works best in Google chrome

- the timezone is represented in number of minutes away from UTC

- will have to alow access to location each time the user presses start/stop (only when online)

- if there is no wifi connection, the program uses the latitude and longitude last stored in locl storage

- It usually takes about 3-5 seconds for the first entry to appear in the table
- Wait for the first row to appear before hitting stop or reset.
- After the first row, consecutive row inserts are very fast
- This is likely because it takes a while to obtain the user's location initially before it is cached

- occassionally the very first call to get the user's 
location is very slow (around 10-40 second wait) If this happens
try closing the page and restarting. If this still does not fix it,
wait a minute after starting the watch and the first entry should eventually appear.
- Note on this: This happens very infrequently and may just be caused
by bad wifi connection

- For some reason, the geolocation does not 
get pulled properly in Safari but it might just be my computer.
