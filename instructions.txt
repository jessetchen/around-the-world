Instructions to build program. 

1. Download entire folder.
2. Run index.html in a browser (preferrably Google chrome)

Notes
- works best in Google chrome

- occassionally the very first call to get the user's 
location is very slow (around 10-40 second wait) If this happens
try closing the page and restarting. If this still does not fix it,
wait a minute after starting the watch and the first entry should eventually appear.
- Note on this: This happens very infrequently and may just be caused
by bad wifi connection as it usually only takes a second to appear

- For some reason, the geolocation does not 
get pulled properly in Safari but it might just be my computer.
