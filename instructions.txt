Instructions to build program

1. Download entire folder.
2. Run index.html in a browser (preferrably Google chrome)


Assumptions:
1. Elapsed time is in seconds
2. Timezone is in minutes away from UTC
3. table entries are stored as strings
4. when offline, the program simply uses the latest lat and lon values (from local storage)

Notes
- works best in Google chrome

- the timezone is represented in number of minutes away from UTC

- will have to alow access to location each time the user presses start/stop (only when online)

- if there is no wifi connection, the program uses the latitude and longitude last stored in local storage

- It usually takes about 3-5 seconds for the first entry to appear in the table
- Wait for the first row to appear before hitting stop or reset.
- After the first row, consecutive row inserts are very fast
- This is likely because it takes a while to obtain the user's location initially before it is cached

- occassionally the very first call to get the user's 
location is very slow (around 10-40 second wait) If this happens
try closing the page and restarting. If this still does not fix it,
wait a minute after starting the watch and the first entry should eventually appear.
- Note on this: This happens very infrequently and may just be caused
by bad wifi connection

- For some reason, the geolocation does not 
get pulled properly in Safari but it might just be my computer.
